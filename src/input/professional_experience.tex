\begin{cvjob}
    {Research Assistant}
    {Industrial \& Systems Engineering, Texas A\&M University}
    {College Station, TX}
    {September 2023 - Present}
    \item Conceived and authored work that led to \$103k grant from the \textit{Crisman Institute for Petroleum Research}.
    \item Created a framework for long-term risk assessment in CCS projects with interpretable AI surrogates and frugal reservoir simulations.
    \item Applied methodology to a proof-of-concept case study of long-term CO\textsubscript{2} storage in a saline aquifer.
    The machine learning models achieved a 500\( \times \) training speedup in relation to CMG's GEM while obtaining prediction errors around 2\%.

    {Researcher}
    {Applied Computational Intelligence Laboratory (ICA/PUC-Rio)}
    {Rio de Janeiro, Brazil}
    {March 2018 - July 2021}
    \item Built custom genetic algorithms and software to optimize subsea production systems.
    \item Created Python libraries for communication with reservoir and flow simulation software, including parsing and writing models, as well as running simulations and interpreting results, in both local computers and HPC clusters.
    \item Conceived a GAN-LSTM coupled simulator surrogate in the context of reservoir optimization and value of information and flexibility brought by smart wells.
    The novel coupling reduced prediction error from 18.93\% to 9.71\%.
    \item Spearheaded introduction of deep learning and explainable AI into established workflows for subsea object detection and classification.
